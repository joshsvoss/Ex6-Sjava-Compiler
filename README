name are declared in the same scope.

GlobalClosingBracketException.java - This exception is thrown when the parser encounters a closing bracket 
in the global scope.

GlobalIfWhileException.java - This exception is thrown when the parser encounters an if or while block in 
the global scope. 

GlobalMethodCallException.java - This exception is thrown when a method is called in the global scope.

MissingMethodReturnException.java -  This exception is thrown when a method is missing its return 
statement.  

NestedMethodDeclarationException.java - This exception is thrown when a method is declared inside another.  

Parser.java - This class handles reading in the Sjava file and parsing through it.

Sjavac.java - This class is the driver class of the Sjava code legality verifier. 

SJavacException.java - This is the parent exception for all exceptions of Sjava syntax nature.  All 
exceptions that are thrown because of a problem with the Sjava program specified in the cmd lin argument
extend this exception.

SymbolTableList.java - This is the class for the  SybolTableList, a data structure that holds our variables.
